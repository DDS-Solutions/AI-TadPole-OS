---

# /plan - Project Planning Mode

$ARGUMENTS

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL RULES

1. **NO CODE WRITING** - This command creates plan file only
2. **Use project-planner agent** - NOT Antigravity Agent's native Plan mode
3. **Socratic Gate** - Ask clarifying questions before planning
4. **Dynamic Naming** - Plan file named based on task

---

## Task

Use the `project-planner` agent with this context:

```
CONTEXT:
- **User Request**: $ARGUMENTS
- **Socratic Gate**: MANDATORY. Ask 3+ clarifying questions before drafting.
- **Verification Gate**: Integrate `verify_all.py` as the final Phase in the output.
- **Output**: `docs/PLAN-{task-slug}.md` (dynamic naming)

NAMING RULES:
1. Extract 2-3 key words from request
2. Lowercase, hyphen-separated
3. Max 30 characters
4. Example: "e-commerce cart" → PLAN-ecommerce-cart.md

RULES:
1. Follow project-planner.md Phase 0 (Socratic Gate).
2. Create PLAN-{slug}.md with the **Sovereign 4-Pillars** breakdown.
3. Integrate `parity_guard.py` checks into the plan's verification phase.
4. DO NOT write any code files.
```

## Expected Output

| Deliverable | Location |
|-------------|----------|
| Project Plan | `docs/PLAN-{task-slug}.md` |
| Task Breakdown | Inside plan file |
| Agent Assignments | Inside plan file |
| Verification Checklist | Phase X in plan file |

---

## After Planning

Tell user:
```
[OK] Plan created: docs/PLAN-{slug}.md

Next steps:
- Review the plan
- Run `/create` to start implementation
- Or modify plan manually
```
